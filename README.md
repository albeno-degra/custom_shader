# Checkerboard Transparency Shader for Flutter

This demo showcases a custom FragmentShader in Flutter that replicates Photoshop-like transparency visualization.  
The shader paints a dynamic checkerboard background (light and dark squares) to highlight areas without fill, making transparent regions clearly visible.

## ✨ Features
- Custom GLSL fragment shader integrated with Flutter.
- Configurable cell size and colors for the checkerboard pattern.
- Can be combined with images, shapes, or custom widgets to visualize transparency.
- Lightweight and GPU-accelerated.

Perfect for experimenting with Flutter’s shader API and understanding how to blend rendering logic with UI.
